Updated QuakeGVR with ArCore *Positional Tracking* and Decoupled 3DOF controller support

I have pretty much stopped supporting this project. Once the Oculus Quest drops, when I find the time, I will look at updating this to work on the Quest, but won't make any promises as to timescales.

I will happily accept pull reuests if there's a feature or fix you want included and am happy to do a quick build/release.

As of now please don't file issues expecting them to be resolved, as that is very unlikely to happen I'm afraid.
